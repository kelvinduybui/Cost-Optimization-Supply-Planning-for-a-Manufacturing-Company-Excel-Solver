## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Constraints & Parameters  
### Definition
- **Chase Plan**: A production strategy where output is adjusted each period to match demand, keeping inventory minimal but causing frequent workforce changes.
- **Level Plan**: A production strategy where output is kept constant over time, stabilizing the workforce but leading to inventory build-up when demand fluctuates.

### Planning Horizon  
- 6 months: **Jan ‚Äì Jun**

  - Do not have any **stockout**  
  - Do not use any **overtime** and **subcontracting**  
  - Try to produce what is demanded (**production closely follows monthly demand; workforce can be adjusted via hiring/layoff**)  

- **Level Plan**  
  - Do not use any **overtime** and **subcontracting**  
  - Produce the **same quantity** every period (**fixed production level each month**)  
  - **Carrying inventory** is allowed  
  - Do not create any **stockout**  
  - Aim to **minimize required capacity** (minimize number of workers needed given fixed production rate)  

### üîé Outputs Required  
- **Month-by-month table**: Gross Demand, Net Demand, Production, Workers Employed, Workers Hired, Workers Laid off, On-hand Inventory, Overtime, Subcontract, Stockout, Total Cost  
- **Scenario comparison**: Total cost breakdown (material, holding, hiring/layoff, salary, OT/subcontract if used, stockout)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Formulation  
### Planning Model  

- Each **row** = 1 month (**Jan‚ÄìJun**)  
- Each **column** = Demand, Workforce, Production, Inventory, Costs  

#### üîπ Inputs: 
- Gross Demand   
- Parameters

#### üîπ Decision Variables
- Production(i)  
- Workers Employed(i)  
- Workers Hired(i)  
- Workers Laid off(i)  
- On-hand Inventory(i)  

#### üîπ Key Formulas

| Description | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| Net demand in period *i* | `Net Demand(i) = Gross Demand(i) ‚Äì Inventory(i‚Äì1)` |
| Production quantity in period *i* | `Production(i) = WorkersEmployed(i) √ó WorkingDay √ó WorkingHour √∑ NetProductionTime` |
| Number of workers employed in period *i* | `WorkersEmployed(i) = Workers(i‚Äì1) + Hired(i) ‚Äì LaidOff(i)` |
| Inventory balance at end of period *i* | `On-hand Inventory(i) = Inventory(i‚Äì1) + Production(i) + Overtime(i) + Subcontract(i) + Stockout(i) ‚Äì Stockout(i‚Äì1) ‚Äì Gross Demand(i)` |
| Total cost in period *i* | `Total Monthly Cost(i) = Production(i) √ó MaterialCost + WorkersEmployed(i) √ó RegularTimeSalary + Hired(i) √ó HiringCost + LaidOff(i) √ó LayoffCost + Inventory(i) √ó HoldingCost + Overtime(i) √ó OvertimeCost + Subcontract(i) √ó SubcontractCost + Stockout(i) √ó StockoutCost` |

#### üîπ Solver Objective
- **Minimize**: TotalCost = Cost(Jan) + Cost(Feb) + Cost(Mar) + Cost(Apr) + Cost(May) + Cost(Jun)
- Ensure all constraints defined by the chosen plan are satisfied.

  - **Cost structure:** Total cost = **284,088 USD**, mainly from **regular-time salaries, initial layoff cost, and rising inventory holding cost** (no overtime, subcontracting, or stockouts).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations
### Insights

#### Cost Structure Trade-off
‚ö° **Chase Plan**: Total cost = **484,250 USD**.  
- ‚úÖ **Advantage**: Almost **no inventory** ‚Üí inventory cost nearly zero.  
- ‚ùå **Drawback**: **Workforce fluctuates** heavily ‚Üí high hiring/layoff costs and labor management challenges.  

üìä **Level Plan**: Total cost = **284,088 USD**.  
- ‚úÖ **Advantage**: **Stable workforce** with minimal fluctuation ‚Üí easier labor management.  
- ‚ùå **Drawback**: **Inventory builds up** significantly ‚Üí high inventory holding cost.  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Feasibility

‚ö° **Chase**: High **HR management risks** (continuous layoffs & hiring ‚Üí lower employee morale, higher training costs).  

üìä **Level**: High **financial and storage risks** (large inventory, potential obsolescence, especially for short product life cycles).  

### Recommendations
- If the company prioritizes **labor stability** ‚Üí lean toward **Level plan**.
- If the company prioritizes **inventory minimization & working capital** efficiency ‚Üí lean toward **Chase plan**.
- However, **Pure Chase or Level plan** is not optimal ‚Üí A **hybrid approach** is preferable: e.g., maintain a leveled production rate around the average demand + allow some overtime/subcontracting to cover peak demand reduces inventory without excessive workforce fluctuation.
