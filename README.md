## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Context

üìò **Main Context**  

- The company is a **gardening tools manufacturer** with **peak demand** occurring in **spring**, creating strong **seasonality in sales**.
- It operates in a **highly competitive market** where **efficient production and inventory management** are critical to sustain **customer satisfaction** and **cost efficiency**.
- At the start of the planning horizon (**January**), the company has **1,000 units of inventory** and **80 workers**.
- To respond to demand fluctuations, management can consider multiple options: **hiring or laying off workers**, **allocating overtime**, **subcontracting**, **backordering** in peak periods, or **carrying inventory** in low-demand months.
- No strict limits are imposed on **subcontracting, inventory, or backorders**, but all generate associated **costs** that must be accounted for.
- The **Supply Planning team** is tasked with building a **6-month aggregate production plan (Jan‚ÄìJun)** using **Excel/Solver** that:
  - Ensures **demand fulfillment** while complying with **operational constraints**.  
  - Compares alternative **strategies** (e.g., **Chase** vs. **Level**) to evaluate **cost trade-offs**.  
  - Reflects different **constraints/targets** depending on the chosen strategy (e.g., **ending inventory target** for **Chase**, **workforce stability** for **Level**).  
- **Objective:** **Minimize total operating cost** while achieving **service level targets** and supporting **efficient resource utilization**.

üë• **Target Audience**  
- Supply Planning & Production Planning Teams  
- Operations & Manufacturing Managers  
- Decision-makers & Stakeholders  

üéØ **Objective**  
To design a **supply planning model** that ensures **demand fulfillment, prevents stockouts, minimizes costs** (inventory, production, overtime, subcontracting), and improves **resource utilization** ‚Äî ultimately supporting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.  

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Used**  
- **Excel:** Used to input data and calculate costs (**inventory, workforce, hiring/layoff, overtime, subcontracting, etc.**) through direct formulas  

- **Excel Solver:** Used to test different planning strategies (**Chase vs. Level**) and determine the **optimal production‚Äìworkforce plan** under constraints (**no stockouts, ending inventory requirement, limited overtime, etc.**)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Constraints & Parameters  
### üìñ Definition
- **Chase Plan**: A production strategy where output is adjusted each period to match demand, keeping inventory minimal but causing frequent workforce changes.
- **Level Plan**: A production strategy where output is kept constant over time, stabilizing the workforce but leading to inventory build-up when demand fluctuates.

### ‚è≥ Planning Horizon  
- 6 months: **Jan ‚Äì Jun**

### üìã Specific Business Rules  

- ‚ö° **Chase Plan**  
  - Do not create any inventory from **Jan to May**, ending inventory of **June = 500**  
  - Do not have any **stockout**  
  - Do not use any **overtime** and **subcontracting**  
  - Try to produce what is demanded (**production closely follows monthly demand; workforce can be adjusted via hiring/layoff**)  

- üìä **Level Plan**  
  - Do not use any **overtime** and **subcontracting**  
  - Produce the **same quantity** every period (**fixed production level each month**)  
  - **Carrying inventory** is allowed  
  - Do not create any **stockout**  
  - Aim to **minimize required capacity** (minimize number of workers needed given fixed production rate)  

### üîé Outputs Required  
- **Month-by-month table**: Gross Demand, Net Demand, Production, Workers Employed, Workers Hired, Workers Laid off, On-hand Inventory, Overtime, Subcontract, Stockout, Total Cost

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Formulation
### Why Excel Solver  
- **Excel Solver** = optimization tool: It finds the **best outcome** (e.g., minimize cost, maximize profit) for a given problem in Excel.
- **Concept**: Based on three elements ‚Äì **objective function** (goal), **decision variables** (controllable inputs), and **constraints** (limitations). Solver adjusts the variables to optimize the goal.
- **Meaning**: Enables **decision-making** in real-world scenarios (production planning, workforce allocation, inventory management) **without the need for coding**.

### üèóÔ∏è Planning Model  

- Each **row** = 1 month (**Jan‚ÄìJun**)  
- Each **column** = Demand, Workforce, Production, Inventory, Costs  

#### üîπ Inputs: 
- Gross Demand (i): number of gross demand needed in period i.    
- Parameters

#### üîπ Decision Variables
- Workers Hired(i): number of workers hired in period i.  
- Workers Laid off(i): number of workers laid off in period i.
- Overtime(i): number of units produced through overtime in period i.
- Subcontract(i): number of units subcontracted in period i.
- Stockout(i): number of backlogged (unmet) demand units carried to next period from period i.

  - **Cost driven by labor**: **Total cost = 484,250 USD**, mainly from **hiring/layoff expenses** and **regular-time salaries**, with **no overtime, subcontracting, or stockouts**.

- üìä **Level Plan**:
  - Cost is concentrated in worker employed (48%) and production (30%), with additional burden from inventory holding (14%) and layoff (8%), reflecting **stable workforce but high inventory**.
  - **Cost structure:** Total cost = **284,088 USD**, mainly from **regular-time salaries, initial layoff cost, and rising inventory holding cost** (no overtime, subcontracting, or stockouts).

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations
### Insights

#### Cost Structure Trade-off
‚ö° **Chase Plan**: Total cost = **484,250 USD**.  
- ‚úÖ **Advantage**: Almost **no inventory** ‚Üí inventory cost nearly zero.  
- ‚ùå **Drawback**: **Workforce fluctuates** heavily ‚Üí high hiring/layoff costs and labor management challenges.  

üìä **Level Plan**: Total cost = **284,088 USD**.  
- ‚úÖ **Advantage**: **Stable workforce** with minimal fluctuation ‚Üí easier labor management.  
- ‚ùå **Drawback**: **Inventory builds up** significantly ‚Üí high inventory holding cost.  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Feasibility

‚ö° **Chase**: High **HR management risks** (continuous layoffs & hiring ‚Üí lower employee morale, higher training costs).  

üìä **Level**: High **financial and storage risks** (large inventory, potential obsolescence, especially for short product life cycles).  

### Recommendations
- If the company prioritizes **labor stability** ‚Üí lean toward **Level plan**.
- If the company prioritizes **inventory minimization & working capital** efficiency ‚Üí lean toward **Chase plan**.
- However, **Pure Chase or Level plan** is not optimal ‚Üí A **hybrid approach** is preferable: e.g., maintain a leveled production rate around the average demand + allow some overtime/subcontracting to cover peak demand reduces inventory without excessive workforce fluctuation.
